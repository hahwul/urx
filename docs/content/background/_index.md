Urx was inspired by [gau (GetAllUrls)](https://github.com/lc/gau), a tool that fetches known URLs from AlienVault's Open Threat Exchange, the Wayback Machine, and Common Crawl. While sharing similar core functionality, Urx was built from the ground up in Rust with a focus on performance, concurrency, and expanded filtering capabilities.
